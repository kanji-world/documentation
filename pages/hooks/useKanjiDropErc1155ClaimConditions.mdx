# useKanjiDropErc721ClaimConditions

React Hook that returns an array of ERC721 claim conditions and its loading and error states.

## Description

This React Hook returns an array of ERC721 claim conditions stored in a contract along with its loading and error states based on the provided arguments. It uses `useKanjiDropErc1155ClaimCondition` and `useQuery` hooks from the `@kanji-world/contracts-types` package to fetch the claim conditions and its respective count.

A claim condition is a structure that represents the sale phases you've set up in the Kanji studio:
- `startsAt`: the timestamp at which the sale phase starts.
- `endsAt`: the timestamp at which the sale phase ends.
- `maxClaimableSupply`: the maximum number of tokens that can be claimed during the sale phase.
- `supplyClaimed`: the number of tokens that have already been claimed during the sale phase.
- `quantityLimitPerTransaction`: the maximum number of tokens that can be claimed in a single transaction.
- `waitTimeInSecondsBetweenClaims`: the minimum number of seconds that must elapse between claims.
- `merkleRoot`: the Merkle root of the claimable tokens for the sale phase.
- `pricePerToken`: the price of a token in WEI.
- `metadata`: the metadata of the sale phase.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useKanjiDropErc721ClaimConditions } from '@kanji-world/react-sdk'

function MyComponent() {
  const { claimConditions, isLoading, isError, error } = useKanjiDropErc721ClaimConditions({
    address: "0xb9b1eed0aefad0ad8c23f717a6a4d4eb75ffed39",
    editionId: 1,
  })

  // Your component logic
}
```

## Return Value

An object with the following properties:

- `claimConditions`: an array of objects representing the ERC721 claim conditions stored in the contract.
- `isLoading`: a boolean indicating whether the claim conditions are currently loading.
- `isSuccess`: a boolean indicating whether the claim conditions have been successfully retrieved.
- `isError`: a boolean indicating whether an error has occurred while retrieving the claim conditions.
- `error`: an Error object containing errors from the claim conditions retrieval process.
