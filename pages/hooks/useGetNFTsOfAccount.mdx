# useGetNFTsOfAccount
This React Hook allows you to fetch NFTs associated with a specific account. It returns an object with the fetched NFTs and additional properties for tracking the query status.

## Usage
To use `useGetNFTsOfAccount`, import it from its file and call it with an object containing the required props. The resulting object will include the fetched NFTs and other properties related to the query.

```tsx
import { useGetNFTsOfAccount } from '@kanji-world/react-sdk'

const { nfts, isLoading, isError, error } = useGetNFTsOfAccount({ address: '0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111', chainId: 1 })

if (isLoading) {
  return <div>Loading NFTs...</div>
}

if (isError) {
  return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>
}

return (
  <div>
    {nfts.map((nft) => (
      <div key={nft.id}>{nft.name}</div>
    ))}
  </div>
)
```

In the example above, `useGetNFTsOfAccount` is called with an object containing the required address (account address) and chainId (chain ID) props.
