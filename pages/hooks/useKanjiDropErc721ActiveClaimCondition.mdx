# useKanjiDropErc721ActiveClaimCondition

This hook retrieves the active ERC721 claim condition, based on the provided address, and returns an object containing its loading and error states, whether or not it has been successfully retrieved, and its error object, if any.

A claim condition is a structure that represents the sale phases you've set up in the Kanji studio:
- `startsAt`: the timestamp at which the sale phase starts.
- `endsAt`: the timestamp at which the sale phase ends.
- `maxClaimableSupply`: the maximum number of tokens that can be claimed during the sale phase.
- `supplyClaimed`: the number of tokens that have already been claimed during the sale phase.
- `quantityLimitPerTransaction`: the maximum number of tokens that can be claimed in a single transaction.
- `waitTimeInSecondsBetweenClaims`: the minimum number of seconds that must elapse between claims.
- `merkleRoot`: the Merkle root of the claimable tokens for the sale phase.
- `pricePerToken`: the price of a token in WEI.
- `metadata`: the metadata of the sale phase.
