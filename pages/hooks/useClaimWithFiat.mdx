# useClaimWithFiat

This React Hook provides an easy way to initiate the process of claiming tokens with fiat. It returns an object with `claimWithFiat`, a function that can be called to start the process, along with loading and error states for the mutation process.

## Usage

To use `useClaimWithFiat`, simply import it from its file and call it with an object containing the necessary props. The resulting object will contain `claimWithFiat`, a function that can be called to initiate the token claiming process with fiat.

```tsx
import { useClaimWithFiat } from '@kanji-world/react-sdk'

const { claimWithFiat, isLoading, isError } = useClaimWithFiat({ address: '0x123...', receiver: '0x456...' })
```

In the example above, `useClaimWithFiat` is called with an object containing the necessary `address` and `receiver` props. The resulting object contains `claimWithFiat`, `isLoading`, and `isError`, all of which can be used to track the progress of the mutation process.

## Return Value

An object with the following properties:

- `claimWithFiat`: a function that can be called to initiate the token claiming process with fiat.
- `isLoading`: a boolean indicating whether the mutation process is currently loading.
- `isSuccess`: a boolean indicating whether the mutation process has been successfully completed.
- `isError`: a boolean indicating whether an error has occurred during the mutation process.
- `error`: an Error object containing errors from the mutation process.

## Configuration

The `useClaimWithFiat` hook accepts an object with the following optional properties as configuration:

- `address`: (`0x${string}`) The address of the contract.
- `reciever`: (`0x${string}`) The recipient of the claimed tokens.
- `amount`: (number) The amount of tokens to claim.
