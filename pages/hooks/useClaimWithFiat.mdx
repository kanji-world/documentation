# useClaimWithFiat

This React Hook provides an easy way to initiate the process of claiming tokens with fiat. It returns an object with `claimWithFiat`, a function that can be called to start the process, along with loading and error states for the mutation process.

## Usage

To use `useClaimWithFiat`, simply import it from its file and call it with an object containing the necessary props. The resulting object will contain `claimWithFiat`, a function that can be called to initiate the token claiming process with fiat. The function is asynchronous and will resolve as soon as the payment succeeds.

```tsx
import { useClaimWithFiat } from '@kanji-world/react-sdk'
import { useAccount } from 'wagmi'

const { claimWithFiat, isLoading, isError } = useClaimWithFiat({ address: '0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111', receiver: '0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333' })

const { address: account } = useAccount()

return (
  <button
    onClick={() =>
      claimWithFiat?.({
        lastnameCustomer: 'string',
        firstnameCustomer: 'string',
        emailCustomer: 'string@string.fr',
      })
    }
    disabled={!account || isLoading}
  >
    Fiat Claim
  </button>
)
```

In the example above, `useClaimWithFiat` is called with an object containing the necessary `address` (collection address) and `receiver` (the receiver of the tokens) props. The resulting object contains `claimWithFiat`, `isLoading`, and `isError`, all of which can be used to track the progress of the mutation process. Important note that the `isLoading` hook does not reflect the loading state of the actual payment â€“ it reflects the loading state of the callback itself, as it is not available if the `address` or the `receiver` are not provided.


## Return Value

An object with the following properties:

- `claimWithFiat`: a function that can be called to initiate the token claiming process with fiat.
- `isLoading`: a boolean indicating whether the mutation process is currently loading.
- `isSuccess`: a boolean indicating whether the mutation process has been successfully completed.
- `isError`: a boolean indicating whether an error has occurred during the mutation process.
- `error`: an Error object containing errors from the mutation process.
